SSR - Server Side Rendering -> response sent is in html format (faster than CSR)
                            -> (if we know that client will surely be a browser)
                        // Fixed format : img/html/text
                        // client depends on browser
                        // fast and secure
                        // example: google.com uses SSR
CSR - Client Side Rendering  -> xml/json(standard)  , used in cross-platform arch.

Restful API - rules

1) Client Server Architecture   - Request response model
-Client and Server are independent entities
-Client: browser, mobile, alexa,....,smartdevice
-Response : json (CSR: client will handle the json data and render it their side)

2) always respect all HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

a - POST /createUser        (Not a good practice)
b - POST /updateUser 
c- GET  /getUser

instead follow REST API standards and utilize HTTP methods
a- POST /user
b- PATCH /user
c- GET / user
