How Versioning works in NodeJs

"dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2"
}



^4.21.2

^ -> carrot symbol (shows when you will update the express version it will update <5.0.0  , i.e. will pick updated bug fix and minor release, won't update major release version)  / compatible with version

~ -> (can update only till minor release) / approximately equivalent to version

latest ->   (XXXXXXXX 
                not recommended , will pick the most updated version, and if major version is changed, your code can break 
            XXXXXXX)


4 (1st part)-> major release/ breaking update(can break your code, always check "change-log / history.md) file

21 (2nd part)-> bug fix release/new feature added/security-update (recommended)

2 (3rd part)-> minor release (deprecated something or minor change : optional)



version: "4.13.4" -> locked version, won't get updated
         "~4.13.4" -> can update till minor release
         "^4.13.4" -> can update on bug fix release or minor release
